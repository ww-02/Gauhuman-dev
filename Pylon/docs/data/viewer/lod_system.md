# Level of Detail (LOD) System

## 🎯 **Core Philosophy: Dual LOD Approach for Point Cloud Optimization**

The LOD system provides two complementary approaches for efficient point cloud rendering:

### **1. Continuous LOD** 
- **Camera frustum binning**: Divides 3D space into camera-aligned bins
- **Distance-weighted sampling**: Uses 1/d² weighting to preserve detail near camera
- **Real-time adaptation**: Dynamically calculates optimal subsampling for current view
- **Use case**: Interactive viewing with dynamic camera movement

### **2. Discrete LOD**
- **Pre-computed levels**: Creates fixed reduction levels (50% per level, 4 levels)
- **Fast level selection**: Simple lookup of pre-computed downsampled point clouds
- **Distance-based selection**: Chooses appropriate level based on camera distance
- **Use case**: Performance-critical applications with predictable viewing patterns

**Core Principle**: Choose the right approach based on performance vs. adaptability trade-offs.

## 🧠 **System Architecture**

```python
# Continuous LOD - Real-time adaptive sampling
from data.viewer.utils.continuous_lod import ContinuousLOD
continuous_lod = ContinuousLOD(spatial_bins=64, distance_exponent=2.0)
subsampled_pc = continuous_lod.subsample(point_cloud, camera_state, target_points)

# Discrete LOD - Pre-computed level selection  
from data.viewer.utils.discrete_lod import DiscreteLOD
discrete_lod = DiscreteLOD(reduction_factor=0.5, num_levels=4)
discrete_lod.precompute_levels(point_cloud, "pc_id")
subsampled_pc = discrete_lod.select_level("pc_id", camera_state)
```

## 📊 **Continuous LOD: Hybrid Sampling**

### **Algorithm Steps:**
1. **Distance Weighting**: Calculate importance weights using 1/d² relationship
2. **Spatial Binning**: Divide viewing frustum into camera-aligned 3D bins
3. **Weighted Sampling**: Sample from each bin proportional to total distance weights
4. **Coverage Guarantee**: Ensure spatial distribution across entire view

### **Benefits:**
- **Adaptive detail**: More points preserved where camera is focused
- **Spatial coverage**: Bins prevent clustering and empty regions
- **Real-time**: Fast 3D calculations without screen projection
- **Quality preservation**: Distance weighting maintains visual importance

### **Configuration:**
```python
ContinuousLOD(
    spatial_bins=64,           # Number of 3D bins (4x4x4 = 64)
    distance_exponent=2.0,     # Distance weighting power (1/d²)
    min_points=2000,           # Minimum points to preserve
    max_reduction=0.8          # Maximum 80% reduction allowed
)
```

## 🎚️ **Discrete LOD: Pre-computed Levels**

### **Level Structure:**
- **Level 0**: Original point cloud (100%)
- **Level 1**: 50% reduction (voxel downsampling)
- **Level 2**: 75% reduction (25% remaining)
- **Level 3**: 87.5% reduction (12.5% remaining)
- **Level 4**: 93.75% reduction (6.25% remaining)

### **Selection Strategy:**
```python
# Distance-based automatic selection
if avg_distance < 2.0:      level = 0  # Close: use original
elif avg_distance < 5.0:    level = 1  # Medium close
elif avg_distance < 10.0:   level = 2  # Medium far  
else:                       level = 3  # Far: aggressive reduction

# Or manual target-based selection
best_level = find_closest_level_to_target(target_points)
```

### **Benefits:**
- **Instant access**: No real-time computation required
- **Predictable performance**: Fixed levels with known point counts
- **Memory efficient**: Voxel-based downsampling preserves shape
- **Simple integration**: Just level selection logic needed

## 🔧 **Integration Guide**

### **Basic Usage - Continuous LOD:**
```python
from data.viewer.utils.continuous_lod import ContinuousLOD

# Automatic target calculation
continuous_lod = ContinuousLOD()
target_points = continuous_lod.calculate_target_points(point_cloud, camera_state)
result = continuous_lod.subsample(point_cloud, camera_state, target_points)

# Manual target specification
result = continuous_lod.subsample(point_cloud, camera_state, 25000)
```

### **Basic Usage - Discrete LOD:**
```python
from data.viewer.utils.discrete_lod import DiscreteLOD

# Pre-compute levels once
discrete_lod = DiscreteLOD()
discrete_lod.precompute_levels(point_cloud, "unique_pc_id")

# Fast level selection
result = discrete_lod.select_level("unique_pc_id", camera_state)

# Or target-based selection
result = discrete_lod.select_level("unique_pc_id", camera_state, target_points=15000)
```

### **Integration in Point Cloud Viewer:**
```python
def create_point_cloud_figure(points, camera_state, lod_enabled=True, lod_type="continuous"):
    if lod_enabled:
        if lod_type == "continuous":
            # Real-time adaptive LOD
            lod = ContinuousLOD()
            target = lod.calculate_target_points(pc_dict, camera_state)
            points = lod.subsample(pc_dict, camera_state, target)
        elif lod_type == "discrete":
            # Pre-computed level LOD
            lod = DiscreteLOD()
            points = lod.select_level(pc_id, camera_state)
    
    # Render with Plotly
    return create_plotly_figure(points)
```

| Medium (50K-200K) | 200-500ms | <1ms | Very Good |
| Large (>200K) | 1-3s | <1ms | Good |

## 🚀 **When to Use Each Approach**

### **Use Continuous LOD When:**
- Interactive camera movement with frequent view changes
- Need adaptive detail based on viewing distance
- Real-time quality optimization is priority
- Memory usage should be minimized (no pre-computation)

### **Use Discrete LOD When:**
- Performance is critical (gaming, real-time applications)
- View patterns are predictable or limited
- Can afford pre-computation time and memory
- Need guaranteed frame rates with instant LOD switching

### **Hybrid Approach:**
```python
# Use discrete for fast interaction, continuous for final quality
if is_user_interacting():
    result = discrete_lod.select_level(pc_id, camera_state)
else:
    result = continuous_lod.subsample(pc_dict, camera_state, high_quality_target)
```

## 🛠️ **Advanced Configuration**

### **Continuous LOD Tuning:**
```python
# High quality (slower)
continuous_lod = ContinuousLOD(
    spatial_bins=125,          # 5x5x5 for finer spatial control
    distance_exponent=1.5,     # Less aggressive distance weighting
    max_reduction=0.6          # Conservative 60% max reduction
)

# Performance optimized (faster)
continuous_lod = ContinuousLOD(
    spatial_bins=27,           # 3x3x3 for faster binning
    distance_exponent=2.5,     # More aggressive distance weighting
    max_reduction=0.9          # Allow up to 90% reduction
)
```

### **Discrete LOD Tuning:**
```python
# Conservative levels
discrete_lod = DiscreteLOD(
    reduction_factor=0.7,      # 30% reduction per level
    num_levels=3               # Fewer, higher quality levels
)

# Aggressive levels
discrete_lod = DiscreteLOD(
    reduction_factor=0.3,      # 70% reduction per level
    num_levels=5               # More levels for fine control
)
```
