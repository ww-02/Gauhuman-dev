"""Pitch/yaw rotation utilities.

This module provides helper functions for converting between pitch/yaw angles
and rotation matrices while assuming zero roll. These helpers mirror the API
style of the other rotation utilities and internally reuse the Euler
conversions to keep behaviour consistent across the codebase.
