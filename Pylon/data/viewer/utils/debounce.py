    This implements a debouncing mechanism that:
    - Executes first call immediately to show immediate feedback
    - Schedules last call to execute after 1 second delay
    - Cancels intermediate calls but preserves the final user interaction
    - Uses PreventUpdate for intermediate calls to avoid UI updates
