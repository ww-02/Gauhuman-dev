    """Map world-frame points into the camera local frame.

    High-level API that builds the world-to-camera 4x4 matrix by inverting the
    camera-to-world extrinsic and applies it to the points via apply_transform.

    Args:
        points: Float torch.Tensor of shape [N, 3] in world coordinates, on the
            same device as extrinsics.
        extrinsics: Float torch.Tensor of shape [4, 4] representing the
            camera-to-world (pose) transform in the OpenCV convention, on the same
            device as points.
        inplace: If True, the camera-frame coordinates are written back into
            points and points is returned; if False, a new tensor is returned.
        max_divide: Maximum number of times the matmul may halve its row batch on
            CUDA OOM (forwarded to apply_transform).
        num_divide: If not None, the fixed number of halvings for the matmul row
            batch (forwarded to apply_transform).

    Returns:
        Float torch.Tensor of shape [N, 3] in the camera local frame (OpenCV:
        +Z forward). The same tensor as points when inplace.
