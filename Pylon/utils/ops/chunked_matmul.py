    The chunk size is ceil(N / 2 ** num_divide) when num_divide is set, otherwise it starts at N and is halved on each CUDA OOM up to max_divide times, releasing cached CUDA memory between attempts. The loop is resume-safe: a halving continues from the first not-yet-written chunk and never recomputes a completed one, so the in-place path can never double-transform an already-written row. Peak memory follows three paths: inplace overwrites large with no output allocation (only a per-chunk intermediate); the not-inplace no-grad path writes each chunk straight into the output (output only, no intermediate); the not-inplace grad path index-assigns each chunk (output plus a per-chunk intermediate, the autograd-safe minimum).

    Args:
        large: Left operand of shape [N, K], any floating dtype.
        small: Right operand of shape [K, K] (square), same dtype and device as large.
        inplace: When True the product overwrites large and large is returned; requires that neither operand requires grad. A CUDA-OOM that exhausts max_divide mid-pass leaves large partially transformed (already-written chunks are not rolled back, since that would need the inverse of small); use inplace=False for all-or-nothing semantics.
        max_divide: Maximum number of chunk halvings on CUDA OOM. int >= 0.
        num_divide: Optional fixed number of halvings, with no OOM retry. int >= 0 when set, else None.

    Returns:
        The [N, K] product, same dtype and device as large; the large object itself when inplace.
